    "In this notebook, we explore the employee compensations in the City of San Francisco in 2015 using various statics, such as mean, standard, median and other percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mentioned dataset contains all employees of the City. However, most often, we don't have access to an entire population but only to a sample of it. Data scientists are interested in making estimates about the population from a sample. However, because the statistic depends on the random sample, a question that arises is how much does the static depend on the particular sample; how different will it be if we had drawn a different sample?\n",

    "To answer this question, in the second part of this notebook, we learn about a technique called **bootstrapping** used to quantify the error or confidence of an estimate."

Then your intervals of estimates will be shorter than those we simulated here, because the \"middle 80%\" is a smaller range than the \"middle 95%\". Only about 80% of your intervals will contain the parameter."
